         <p>Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one - Marcus Aurelius</p>
        </blockquote>

<br>
    <h2>Marcus Aurelius</h2>
        <p>I chose this quote by Marcus Aurelius because he is one of the lesser known philosophers whose teachings
            are not only eye opening but direct at the message they seek to pass.</p>

    <h2>Internet Utilization</h2>
    <p>To effectively use the <b>internet </b>, one needs to first know how to search for what they are looking for on
        <a href="www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>. To begin, one will open the <i><span style="background-color: royalblue">google search engine</span></i> where they will use the key words for what they are looking for
        It would be more effective if one would find the most common words used by the topic and from the results provided, search for extended infromation in the links</p>

    <h2>difference between HTML tags and elements</h2>
    <p>
        an HTML element is the collection of start tag, its attributes, an end tag and everything in between. On the other hand an HTML tag (either opening or closing) is used to mark the start or end of an element, as you can see in the above illustration.
